# Benchmarks

Two Criterion targets, both `harness = false`, neither feature-gated:

| Target | What it measures |
|---|---|
| `bench` | `FingerprintTreeMap` micro-benchmarks (fill, single insert/remove, cumulated range-fingerprint) vs `BTreeMap`, plus the dated-vs-value-only fill and the single-difference `ReplicatedMap` send/reconcile latency. |
| `system` | End-to-end, **public-API** system benchmarks (below). |

Neither target runs in CI — CI only *compile-checks* them (`cargo bench --no-run --features internal-testing`). Run them locally when you want numbers.

## Running the system benchmarks

```sh
# Everything (point-read, memory, bulk-load, cold-sync, durable-rejoin):
cargo bench --bench system

# A single benchmark or size (Criterion treats the argument as a regex over the benchmark id):
cargo bench --bench system -- point_read
cargo bench --bench system -- 'cold_sync/1000'

# A fast pass while iterating (lower statistical confidence):
cargo bench --bench system -- --quick
```

Criterion writes HTML reports and raw CSV under `target/criterion/`; open `target/criterion/report/index.html`. Every corpus is seeded deterministically, so runs are comparable across machines and over time.

## What each benchmark covers

- **`point_read`** — `ReplicatedMap::get` latency vs `HashMap` and `BTreeMap` across dataset sizes. The store walks the B-tree (`O(log n)`), so this quantifies the read-path cost against the flat-map baselines (drives #171).
- **`memory_footprint`** — prints the fixed per-entry footprint of the dated cell `Entry<Timestamp, V>` vs the value-only mirror projection `State<V>` across value payload sizes; the delta is the mirror's per-entry saving (drives #170). Printed, not timed.
- **`bulk_load`** — `insert_bulk` throughput (entries/s) filling an empty store, across sizes (drives #173).
- **`cold_sync`** — wall time for an **empty** node to converge with a **full** one purely via anti-entropy: the full node is pre-loaded before it has any peer (nothing is broadcast eagerly), then the empty node seeds it and pulls the whole dataset through the range-diff protocol; timed until fingerprints match (drives #168). This is a loopback measurement — real-network transmission delays make it larger.
- **`durable_rejoin`** — time to reload an `N`-entry `FileSnapshot` from disk, i.e. the cost a restarting node pays before rejoining (drives #172).

## Not covered yet

- **External comparisons** (e.g. point-read vs Redis over loopback) are intentionally out of scope here to keep the default `cargo bench` dependency-light. They belong behind an optional, non-CI Cargo feature in a follow-up.
- **Scaling** (gossip traffic per node and write→read propagation latency as node count grows) — listed alongside this harness in the #174 rescope but not implemented here; needs an `N`-node in-process harness this file doesn't build yet. Left for a follow-up.
- The `img/perf-*.png` graphs in the repo root are produced out-of-band from the `bench` target's Criterion output; regenerating them is a manual step (there is no committed plotting pipeline).
