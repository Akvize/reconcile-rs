## Examples of how to use `reconcile`

This directory contains one (eventually more) example showcasing various capabilities of
the `reconcile` crate.

The [`rhtree_service`](rhtree_service.rs) example can be executed with:

```
cargo run --release --example rhtree_service 127.0.0.1:8080 127.0.0.1:8081 100000
```

If you've got an example you'd like to see here, please feel free to open an
issue. Otherwise if you've got an example you'd like to add, please feel free
to make a PR!
